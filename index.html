                    Inspired by the complexity and spontaneity of generative music-making software, I was quickly drawn into the world of computer programming.

                    I’ve since found so much to engage with as a programmer outside of my musical interests. Web development/design, in particular, is a skill set that allows me to continuously flex my curiosity while offering the opportunity to adapt my knowledge base to a wide variety of industries.

                    <h3>Sit</h3>
                    <p>
                        ‘Sit’ is a simple, user-friendly meditation timer. It works as a traditional countdown timer, with the option to add brief ‘interval’ alarms/reminders at timed spaces throughout the session. These serve as reminders to focus on the object of meditation.

        <!-- SIT CASE STUDY -->
        <div class="modal fade sit-case-study-modal" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myLargeModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">

                <p>
                    The idea for ‘Sit’ arose after noticing an apparent lack of simple, free, mobile-friendly, web-based mindfulness meditation timing apps designed with user experience in mind. Those that do exist tended to be clunky and awash in a “new-age” aesthetic that seemed off-putting to the average user.
                    
                    My intention was to fill this gap with a tool that was neutral in tone and navigable for users of all backgrounds.
                </p> 
                
                <hr/>

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>
                    I surveyed members of Nashville’s meditation community to get a sense of their typical practice, and which, if any, app based meditation tools they use. Those that use an app reported a strong preference for simplicity and mobility. Some felt that the paid, subscription based nature of many popular meditation apps was a barrier to using them, and others felt that these tools were bloated with lessons, interviews, notifications and other distractions. That said, many still expressed interest in a tool that could track a user’s personal progress over time. The idea of a web-based tool instead of a downloadable app seemed largely appealing to respondants, too. <br/><br/>

                    Finally, some non-meditators I spoke with reported a subtle aversion to the practice, citing the “new-agey” aesthetic that so commonly comes baggage with any “spiritual” endeavor. <br/><br/>
                    
                    With these concerns in mind, I was able to more clearly articulate the challenge that laid ahead: <br/><br/>
                    
                    <span class="challenge-statement" style="font-weight: 400;">How could I offer a simple, functional, web-based meditation timing tool that allowed users of all backgrounds to track their progress over time?</span> <br/><br/>
                </p> 

                <h3>Future Versions</h3>

                <p>
                    ‘Sit’ is very much a work in progress. Future versions will benefit from updated usability tools and enhanced flexibility of timing options.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The sliders on the main page could be reconfigured into pickers (scrollable wheels). This would give the user a broader range of options to choose from. In its current form, the number of options is fixed. The sliders are also generally less responsive on touch-screen devices.

                    <img id="picker" src="./images/picker_example.png"/>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The progress tracking page would benefit from a visual representation of the user’s data, perhaps as a linear graph. This way total progress could be gauged in a single glance. The current ’list’ format is workable, but cumbersome. Additionally, the ‘Back’ button should remain in view at all times. Currently it scrolls out of view when the number of data entries exceeds the size of the screen.

                            <p>
                                User research (email surveys to regular meditators in the Nashville community) suggested that simplicity and mobility were indeed top priorities. There was a general sense that subscription-based meditation apps had too much on offer (ie social connectivity and course offerings that distracted from the practice itself).
